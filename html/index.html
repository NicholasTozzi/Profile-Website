        <h2>My Start at something new</h2>
        <p>My first name is Nicholas, but everyone calls me by my last name.
            I have gone to school for computer science, but I didn't really enjoy the languages I learned along the way.
            I remember as a kid loving editing my MySpace page, and using custom HTML. I mostly just copy and pasted various
            widgets from the internet, but my profile was special because  it was something I had created. I realized my falling
            out with programming may not have been my fault, so I took matters into my own hands.
        </p>
        <p>If 2020 has taught me anything, its that I can't be a server in Orlando Florida forever. COVID-19 has given me a mental
          vacation I didn't know I needed. The quarentine still hasn't ended, but I knew my vacation needed to. School felt unsettling to go back to,
          but I know I needed to make change in my life. I know it is going to be an uphill battle, but I'm looking forward to climbing to the top.

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to improve my abilities, research, and find more understanding in the following:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Smash Brothers</li>
          <li>Adobe Premier</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I have been reading Self Improvement books in order to put myself in a goal oriented mindset.
          I have been wanting to pursue a flexible career path, while learning how to make Smash Brothers 
          Content to share my knoledge with my audiance. Ultimately I would love to help Web Development 
          in some form of esports organization. As a prior full time day dreamer, I can assure that a dream
          can't come true without goals.
