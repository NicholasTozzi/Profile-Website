        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>From my senior year of high school, to about 3 years after high school I hadn't really thought much about my career</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Publix Manager</li>
          <li>Pyramid Scheme Aficionado</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Pretty  short list, right? I didn't have a high image of myself, so I set the bar pretty low for my career goals.
          It wasn't until my 2 year expirience working at a <a href=https://chilis.com class="text">Chili's</a> that I realized that I didn't want to 
          be there forever. The work environment got so unprofessional, and toxic to where I told myself that I deserve better.
          Very odd upbringing story, but sometimes you just have to learn life lessons the hard way.

        <h2>Leisure</h2>
        <p>Right after high school, I had found out that there was a local smash tournament near me.
          I had always dreamed of entering tournaments for this game since I played Super Smash Brothers 
          Melee in 2001. Entering competitions taught me more about myself than I new was possible from playing
          a kids fighting game. Mentality, and the ability to self improve were the skills that I learned in Leisure,
          and now want to put that energy towards my career!
