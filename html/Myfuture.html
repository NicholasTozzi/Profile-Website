      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>As I now have time off, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I plan on capitalizing on learning
        all there is to know about web development. I want to learn as much as I can about other languages as well.
        I'm excited to bring this level of self disipline to learn into other aspects of my life as well.
        Once I'm able to make web pages. I plan on making some pages for my friends, and see what local businesses I may be able to help.
        From getting some expirience under my belt it would be amazing to get into the field, thanks to the wonderful team at Treehouse!

      <h2>Leisure</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately my passion for Smash Brothers has been on the backburner, due to the fact that the Nintendo Online expirience is very much so lacking.
        Now that I have free spare time away from competing, I look forward to learning Adobe Premier so I can make content, and potentially a form of side income!
        Being able to get paid for doing what you love, is something I see more and more value in as I get older.
